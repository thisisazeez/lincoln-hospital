      <strong><p class="text-justify"> A woman who wants to have a baby should monitor whether the first days of her periods tend to occur the same number of days apart every month, which is considered regular. Conversely, her periods may be irregular, meaning her cycle lengths vary from month to month. By tracking this information on a calendar, a woman can better predict when she might be ovulating, which is the time every month when her ovaries will release an egg. You can track your Ovulation period tracker here <mark>( Track your Period )</mark>
 according to the American Pregnancy Association, Before we talk about how to calculate your fertility window, it might be helpful to briefly review the stages of your menstrual cycle, as hormonal changes that occur during the different phases set the stage for ovulation and provide clues as to when ovulation is coming.
As you may already know, in order for conception to take place, at least one healthy and vigorous sperm must be waiting in the fallopian tube at the moment ovulation occurs and must be able to fertilize the egg within 12-24 hours of the egg being released from the ovary.
Since sperm can only live for a maximum of 5 days in the female reproductive tract, only a small number of sperm will even survive the long journey through the female reproductive tract. Therefore, couples trying to conceive should plan to have intercourse a number of times in the days just prior to ovulation.
However, a man's sperm can survive in a woman's body for up to five days.</p></strong>

      <p><strong>Understanding when you're ovulating — and having sex regularly five days before and on the day of ovulation — can improve the odds of conceiving.
Ovulation is the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary. Those six days are important because the egg is able to be fertilized for about 12 to 24 hours after it's released. In addition, sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract as long as five days after sexual intercourse under the right conditions. Your chance of getting pregnant is highest when live sperm are present in the fallopian tubes during ovulation.
In an average 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. But in most women, ovulation occurs in the four days before or after the midpoint of the menstrual cycle. If, like many women, you don't have a perfect 28-day menstrual cycle, you can determine the length and midpoint of your cycle by keeping a menstrual calendar.
Beyond the calendar, you can also look for ovulation signs and symptoms, including,
    • Change in vaginal secretions. Just before ovulation, you might notice an increase in clear, wet and stretchy vaginal secretions. Just after ovulation, cervical mucus decreases and becomes thicker, cloudy and less noticeable.
    • Change in basal body temperature. Your body's temperature at rest (basal body temperature) increases slightly during ovulation. Using a thermometer specifically designed to measure basal body temperature, take your temperature every morning before you get out of bed. Record the results and look for a pattern to emerge. You'll be most fertile during the two to three days before your temperature rises.
You also might want to try an over-the-counter ovulation kit. These kits test your urine for the surge in hormones that takes place before ovulation, which helps you identify when you're most likely to ovulate.</strong></p>

        <strong>to the American Pregnancy Association ,In the first several days of the menstrual cycle (called the follicular phase), certain hormones, specifically follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), begin the maturation process of follicles (the sacs that hold the egg) in the ovaries. In the second week of your cycle, FSH levels begin to decline and a single dominant follicle continues to develop.
This growing follicle produces increasing amounts of estrogen, which initiates the ovulatory phase. Estrogen plays a key role in the ovulatory process and helps to prepare the body for pregnancy. This hormone helps build the lining of the endometrium, facilitates the secretion of fertile-quality cervical mucus (which helps to protect and transport sperm through the reproductive tract) and triggers the production of the luteinizing hormone (LH).

How to Track Ovulation With Irregular Periods 
Many mothers-to-be often ask “How can I track ovulation with irregular periods?”.  This question is very common and there are multiple solutions available.
Irregular periods create a challenge in tracking ovulation and knowing when the best time is to have sex in order to get pregnant. The good news is that tracking ovulation with irregular periods is pretty easy to pinpoint.  You can even track your ovulation with a good amount of precision thanks to the advancement of modern medicine.
One way to track ovulation is by using an ovulation kit or fertility monitor. If you have been trying to conceive for a few months without success, you may consider using an ovulation kit or fertility monitor to help identify the best time to have intercourse. This will help maximize your chances of getting pregnant.

Ovulation kits and the luteinizing hormone (LH),
While the luteinizing hormone is always present in your urine, it increases 24-48 hours prior to ovulation. This LH surge triggers ovulation, the release of an egg from one of your ovaries. Ovulation is the most fertile time of your cycle.
When is the best time to use ovulation kits?
For some women, it can be difficult to know when to start using ovulation tests, particularly if their cycles are irregular. Also, some ovulation kits only come with about a week's worth of tests, which may not be enough to cover the window during which you could ovulate. With this in mind, it is best to wait until you start to notice a build-up of fertile-quality cervical mucus before you begin testing.</strong>

       <p><strong>American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The "fertile window" spans a six-day interval — the five days prior to ovulation and the day of it, very month, a woman is most fertile on these days.

When a woman has identified that fertility window, should they have sex every day? Research has shown that there hasn't been a big difference in pregnancy rates between couples who had sex every day during the "fertile window" (37%) compared with couples who did it every other day (33%), Pavone said. "And having sex every other day might be easier for a couple to pull off," she added. 
Researchers evaluated hundreds of fertility and menstruation apps in the Apple app store, particularly for the quality of the app. The app quality score was based on several factors, such as the app's usability, accuracy of information and tools provided, general features and specific fertility features, they reported in 2019 in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada. While 31 of the apps showed serious inaccuracies, a few rose to the top. Here are the top 3 starting with the apps with the highest AQS scores, 
    • Glow Ovulation, Period Tracker
    • Fertility Friend FF App
    • Clue, Health and Period Tracker
There are plenty of pregnancy myths and old wives' tales about conception. For example, there's no evidence that sex position will influence a couple's chances of having a baby, nor does a woman lying on her back for a certain amount of time after intercourse increase the odds of conceiving, Pavone told Live Science. 
But she said there are some water-based vaginal lubricants that can decrease the movement of sperm, so Pavone recommended using Pre-Seed rather than Astroglide or K-Y Jelly when lubrication is needed.
What to avoid during your Fertility 
To improve your odds of conceiving,
    • Don't smoke. Tobacco has multiple negative effects on fertility, not to mention your general health and the health of a fetus. If you smoke, ask your health care provider to help you quit before conception.
    • Don't drink alcohol. Heavy alcohol use might lead to decreased fertility. Generally, it's best to avoid alcohol if you're hoping to conceive.
    • Curb caffeine. Research suggests that fertility isn't affected by caffeine consumption of less than 200 milligrams a day. That's about one to two cups of 6 to 8 ounces of coffee per day.
    • Don't overdo strenuous exercise. Strenuous, intense exercise of more than five hours a week has been associated with decreased ovulation.
Also, talk to your health care provider about any medications you are taking. Certain medications — even those available without a prescription — can make it difficult to conceive.</strong></p>

       <p><strong>A study published in 2020 in the journal PLOS One, researchers looked at data from more than 50,000 couples in China trying to conceive over the course of a year; they found that women's ability to conceive within a given timeframe decreased as their BMI increased.

A woman's weight can also impact the chances of conceiving, Being overweight or underweight may reduce those odds. Research has shown that a woman who is overweight can take twice as long to become pregnant as a woman whose body-mass index (BMI) is considered normal weight, Pavone said. A woman who is underweight might take four times as long to conceive, she said. 

Having too much body fat produces excess estrogen, which can interfere with ovulation, according to the Cleveland Clinic. A 2017 study suggested that couples in the study in which both partners were very obese, with BMIs of at least 35, took from 55% to 59% longer to become pregnant, compared with couples who were not obese, the researchers reported in the journal Human Reproduction.

Male obesity, which can disrupt the male endocrine system as well as sperm viability and concentration, can also affect a couple's ability to become pregnant, scientists reported in 2020 in the journal Andrologia.
Women who are underweight, with a BMI less than 18, might not be getting regular periods or could stop ovulating, which also hinders their ability to become pregnant, according to the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Authority.</strong></p>

       <strong>Parental health is key to a healthy pregnancy. After all, healthy parents are more likely to have healthy babies. Start with parental health basics, such as updating your vaccines, eating healthy foods, taking prenatal vitamins and exercising regularly.
Parental health takes on additional significance if you have a chronic medical condition that might affect your pregnancy. Work with your health care provider to manage your condition both before and during pregnancy. Remember, taking good care of yourself is the best way to take care of your baby.
Parental health includes considerations about age, too. If you're older than 35 and hoping to get pregnant, understand the issues older mothers face — and know what it takes to have a healthy pregnancy.

Pavone recommends that women who are attempting to conceive start taking a prenatal vitamin even before becoming pregnant. This way, a woman can find one that's more agreeable to her system and stay on it during pregnancy, she said. 
Another possibility is to take a daily multivitamin, as long as it contains at least 400 micrograms (mcg) per day of folic acid, a B vitamin that's important for preventing birth defects in a baby's brain and spine, Pavone said. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges women to take 400 mcg of folic acid every day for at least one month before getting pregnant, to help prevent birth defects. 
Getting a head start on folic acid supplementation is a good idea because the neural tube develops into the brain and spine three to four weeks after conception occurs, before many women may realize they're expecting. </strong>

       <p><strong>Does your general wellness and nutrition impact your ability to conceive? Yes! And both partners can boost their fertility by making key lifestyle changes, dropping unhealthy habits and improving nutrition.  Nutrition Facts Labels highlight the presence and amount of desirable and less desirable nutrients. When shopping, labels should guide the preferential choice of foods rich in potassium, calcium, vitamin D, and other vitamins. Furthermore, food choices with large amounts of sodium added sugars, and fats should be avoided.  


Preconception nutrition research has shown that food and healthy nutrition are tied to fertility health in both women and men.  Plus, there are substances that can hinder fertility. Ideally you would begin making healthy changes 3 months to a year before you conceive.

Do supplements really help fertility? Can medications prevent conception? Ideally you would get all the vitamins and nutrients you need from your diet, but what if you can't? Some fertility supplements like those available from Fairhaven Health go beyond vitamins. They contain antioxidants and key elements that can help boost your fertility.

Pregnancy isn't just a nine-month journey, but a year-long journey. Knowing that the first few weeks of pregnancy are the most vital to the development of the baby, a mother should be healthy and avoid any harmful activities and substances near the time of conception. Some habits are harder to break, and some health issues take longer to address.
Preconception and prenatal health will be beneficial to you and your baby.
Eating a variety of healthy foods can help prepare a woman's body for pregnancy by giving her adequate stores of critical nutrients, such as calcium, protein and iron, research has shown. This means eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, dairy and healthy sources of fat. 

Besides taking a supplement containing folic acid, a woman can also obtain this vitamin from foods such as dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli, fortified breads and cereals, beans, citrus fruits and orange juice. 

According to the Mayo Clinic. When trying to get pregnant, eat lower amounts of high-mercury fish, such as swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish. This is because mercury can accumulate in a pregnant woman's bloodstream, which affects a baby's development,. Also, limit albacore (white) tuna to 6 ounces (170 grams) per week to reduce exposure to this toxic metal, the Food and Drug Administration recommends. A 2019 review found that mercury consumption could also impair men's and women's fertility.

Also, some science suggests that pregnant women should avoid caffeine, Health authorities in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom said that a woman having about 200 mg of caffeine (less than two cups of coffee) will not affect her baby, but a 2020 review study, published in BMJ Evidence Based Medicine, found that there was no safe level of caffeine consumption for pregnant women or for those trying to get pregnant. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Being physically active most days of the week can help a woman's body prepare for the demands of pregnancy and labor, and has been associated with a reduced risk of fertility problems, scientists reported in the March 2020 issue of the journal Human Reproduction. But getting too much exercise or doing frequent strenuous workouts could interfere with ovulation, Live Science reported. 
Doctors see a lot of menstrual disturbances in women who exercise heavily, and a lot of times these women need to cut back on their workouts if they want to become pregnant, Pavone told Live Science.
Time spent on moderate or vigorous physical activity creates the best conditions for healthy babies. Moderate or vigorous physical activity causes the heart to beat faster and makes it a challenge to talk without pausing. Examples of moderate physical activity include brisk walking, dancing, and gardening. The vigorous activity could be running, fast cycling, or playing basketball.
Exercise Tip, The mind exerts a powerful influence on over-exercise habits. Self-efficacy is one's belief in self or confidence in abilities. To become consistently active, a deliberate effort can be made to develop self-efficacy. This effort could initially involve a daily run or walk of 0.5 miles. By gradually increasing the distance covered over weeks, a sense of achievement and an increase in self-efficacy reinforces the active lifestyle. </strong></p>

       <strong>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder, is one of the most common reasons for female infertility. It affects between 6% and 12% of American women of reproductive age.
There is no single test to identify PCOS, but a doctor will determine if a woman fulfills two of the following three criteria, the CDC said,

    Irregular periods or no periods, caused from lack of ovulation 
    Higher than normal levels of male hormones that may result in excess hair on the face and body, acne or thinning scalp hair 
    Multiple small cysts on the ovaries
It is not clear why some women develop this syndrome, although it is often diagnosed when they struggle to get pregnant.
There is a strong link between PCOS-related infertility and weight. About 40% to 60% of women with PCOS are overweight or obese, and healthy eating and exercise have been shown to improve reproductive problems in women with PCOS. A number of prescribed medications may also induce ovulation and regulate insulin levels, such as letrozole and metformin. High levels of insulin push the pituitary gland to release large amounts of hormones that disrupt ovulation.
Another intervention is laparoscopic ovarian drilling, in which a surgeon makes small holes in a woman's ovaries to help reduce the amount of male hormones they produce, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. This procedure, which is done under general anaesthesia, is not without risk, and can also negatively affect fertility if there is too much damage to the ovaries. 
Doctors recommend in-vitro fertilization if other interventions have not worked, or as a primary treatment if monitoring, cost and accessibility are not issues.</strong>

       <strong>Endometriosis is another common reproductive condition, affecting more than one in 10 women in the United States. It occurs when tissue found in the uterus grows in other parts of the body, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes.
Even mild endometriosis can reduce fertility, while severe endometriosis can distort a woman's pelvic anatomy and, for example, block her fallopian tubes, according to a 2015 study in The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of India.
It is still possible for a woman with endometriosis to become pregnant, and, once pregnant, the pregnancy is expected to be no different to that of a woman without endometriosis. Medical treatment through drugs does not improve fertility, according to Endometriosis UK, an endometriosis-focused charity. These medications involve regulating a person's hormones, and can slow the growth of endometrial tissue and prevent new pieces from developing, said the Mayo Clinic. But because these drugs are based on hormones (such as birth control therapies, and drugs that block ovulation or reduce the amount of estrogen), they actively stop a woman from getting pregnant. 
Endometriosis presents differently in different women, so its treatment depends on the individual, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
Surgery to excise the endometrial and scar tissue may improve fertility rates and help reduce pain associated with endometriosis, researchers reported in the 2015 study in The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology of India.
Other fertility treatments –– such as IVF, ovulation induction, artificial insemination and techniques that stimulate a woman's ovaries to produce more eggs –– can also help a woman with endometriosis to become pregnant. But the option depends on the severity of the endometriosis, the woman's age and whether other fertility issues are involved. One concern about fertility treatments is that they can overstimulate ovaries and give rise to high-order multiple pregnancies, as multiple eggs are fertilized, Endometriosis UK said.</strong>

    <p>The most important advice for a woman who wants to get pregnant is to get to know her body, specifically her menstrual cycle, said Dr. Mary Ellen Pavone, a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist, and medical director of the in-vitro fertilization program at North-western Medicine's Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility division in Chicago.
"It's important to know how far apart her cycles are so she can more accurately time intercourse to try to get pregnant," Pavone said. 
Getting pregnant can be an exciting time. For some, getting pregnant seems to happen simply by talking about it. For others, getting pregnant takes patience and perhaps a bit of luck.
Understanding when you're most fertile can make getting pregnant easier. It's also important to consider simple do's and don'ts of conception. For example, maintain a healthy weight and have sex regularly — especially near the time of ovulation. Don't smoke or drink alcohol. Of course, healthy sperm counts, too.
With frequent unprotected sex, most healthy couples conceive within one year. If you have trouble getting pregnant, don't go it alone. A fertility specialist or other health care provider might be able to help. Infertility affects men and women equally — and treatment is available.</p>
