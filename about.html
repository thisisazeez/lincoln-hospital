					<font color="#000" size="3px"> <p>Just as your body went through many changes before birth, it will go through transitions as you recover from childbirth.
Physically you may experience the following,
    <li>Pain at the site of the episiotomy or laceration. An episiotomy is a cut made by your doctor in the perineum (the area between the vagina and the anus) to help deliver the baby or prevent tearing. If this was done, or the area was torn during birth, the stitches may make walking or sitting difficult. It also can be painful when you cough or sneeze during the healing time.
    <li>Sore breasts. Your breasts may be swollen, hard, and painful for several days as your milk comes in. Your nipples may also be sore.
    <li>Hemorrhoids . Hemorrhoids (swollen varicose veins in the anal area) are common after pregnancy and delivery.
    <li>Constipation . Having a bowel movement may be difficult for a few days after delivery. Hemorrhoids, episiotomies, and sore muscles can cause pain with bowel movements.
    <li>Hot and cold flashes. Your body's adjustment to changing levels of hormones and blood flow can cause you to perspire one minute and reach for a blanket to cover yourself the next.
    <li>Urinary or fecal incontinence. Muscles stretched during delivery, particularly after a long labor, may cause you to leak urine when you laugh or sneeze or may make it difficult to control bowel movements,causing accidental bowel leakage.
    <li>After pains. After giving birth, you will continue to experience contractions for a few days as your uterus returns to its pre-pregnancy size. You may notice contractions most while your baby is nursing.
    <li>Vaginal discharge (lochia). Immediately following birth you will experience a bloody discharge heavier than a regular period. Over time, the discharge will fade to white or yellow and then stop entirely within two months.
Emotionally you may experience irritability, sadness, or crying, commonly referred to as the "baby blues," in the days or weeks after delivery. These symptoms occur in up to 80% of new mothers and may be related to physical changes (including hormone changes and exhaustion) and your emotional adjustment to the responsibilities of caring for a newborn.
If these problems persist, inform your doctor or other health professional; you could be experiencing postpartum depression, a more serious problem that affects between 10% and 25% of new mothers.
Sometimes, the mother or baby experiences health problems during pregnancy. Good prenatal care and testing can help prevent, detect, and control some pregnancy complications. </p> <br><br>

      <div class="accordion-body"><strong>fourth trimester is the idea of a transitional period between birth and 12 weeks postpartum during which your baby is adjusting to the world and you are adjusting to your baby. 
While there is often much to be celebrated, it can also be a physically and mentally taxing time for parents and a period of major developmental changes for your baby.
Dr. Harvey Karp, renowned paediatrician and author of The Happiest Baby on the Block, is credited for popularizing the concept of the fourth trimester. 
According to Karp, even full-term human babies are born too soon, and he encourages parents to think of their little ones as fetuses outside the womb for the first 3 months of their lives. 
Parents also experience major transition during the first 12 weeks. The learning curve is real; it takes time to master those swaddling skills and distinguish cries of hunger from those of discomfort. 
Additionally, birth parents may be contending with postpartum pain, breastfeeding challenges, and fluctuating hormones. 
Throw in some sleep deprivation and it's fair to say that new parents have a whole lot on their proverbial plates.</strong></div>

      <div class="accordion-body"><strong>The first 3 months of your baby's life may seem like a blur of poop and spit-up, but there is an abundance of activity occurring on a cellular level, and you get a front-row seat for all the developmental changes. 
By the time a newborn hits the 3-month milestone, they've become little people with budding personalities, curious minds, and basic motor skills. In the meantime, there's a lot you'll be doing to support that development.


Why this time is important 
There's a compelling reason Karp believes babies are born too soon — a newborn's nervous system and brain aren't entirely developed at birth. It takes time for a baby to create those important synapses that help them master skills like smiling.
Fortunately, you can encourage this brain-cell connectivity by interacting with your newborn — holding, rocking, and talking to them fosters activity in a baby's blossoming brain. 
Additionally, while a baby is born with all five senses, some need additional time to mature. A newborn sees light and dark items within an 8- to 10-inch radius most distinctly. By the end of the fourth trimester, however, many babies are better able to focus on smaller items and to notice colors. 
Of course, the fourth trimester also lays the foundation for your baby's continued physical growth and muscular development. 
At birth, a newborn has an array of reflexes — they innately startle, grasp, suck, and root for food. However, throughout the first 3 months of life, a baby's responses will become less automatic and more controlled. 
While a newborn tends to resemble a bobble-head doll in the first couple of weeks, early tummy time work will help them gain the ability to lift their head, push up with their arms, and stretch out those scrawny little legs. It's fascinating how quickly they can master these all-important moves and gain muscular strength. 
Sometime in the fourth trimester, a baby might also learn to bring their hands together, grab a toy, and track a moving item. While all of these are important developmental advances, in the meantime you'll be doing a lot of the same things to care for your fourth trimester baby. </strong></div>

      Handling a Newborn
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body"><strong>If you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, their fragility may be intimidating. Here are a few basics to remember,
    • Wash your hands (or use a hand sanitizer) before handling your baby. Newborns don't have a strong immune system yet, so they're at risk for infection. Make sure that everyone who handles your baby has clean hands.
    • Support your baby's head and neck. Cradle the head when carrying your baby and support the head when carrying the baby upright or when you lay your baby down.
    • Never shake your newborn, whether in play or in frustration. Shaking can cause bleeding in the brain and even death. If you need to wake your infant, don't do it by shaking — instead, tickle your baby's feet or blow gently on a cheek.
    • Make sure your baby is securely fastened into the carrier, stroller, or car seat. Limit any activity that could be too rough or bouncy.
    • Remember that your newborn is not ready for rough play, such as being jiggled on the knee or thrown in the air.<br>
		<li>Bathing Basics</li>
		<h6>You should give your baby a sponge bath until,
    • the umbilical cord falls off and the navel heals completely (1–4 weeks)
    • the circumcision heals (1–2 weeks)
A bath two or three times a week in the first year is fine. More frequent bathing may be drying to the skin.
Have these items ready before bathing your baby,
    • a soft, clean washcloth
    • mild, unscented baby soap and shampoo
    • a soft brush to stimulate the baby's scalp
    • towels or blankets
    • a clean diaper
    • clean clothes
Sponge baths. For a sponge bath, select a safe, flat surface (such as a changing table, floor, or counter) in a warm room. Fill a sink, if nearby, or bowl with warm (not hot!) water. Undress your baby and wrap him or her in a towel. Wipe your infant's eyes with a washcloth (or a clean cotton ball) dampened with water only, starting with one eye and wiping from the inner corner to the outer corner. Use a clean corner of the washcloth or another cotton ball to wash the other eye. Clean your baby's nose and ears with the damp washcloth. Then wet the cloth again and, using a little soap, wash his or her face gently and pat it dry.
Next, using baby shampoo, create a lather and gently wash your baby's head and rinse. Using a wet cloth and soap, gently wash the rest of the baby, paying special attention to creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and in the genital area. Once you have washed those areas, make sure they are dry and then diaper and dress your baby.
Tub baths. When your baby is ready for tub baths, the first baths should be gentle and brief. If he or she becomes upset, go back to sponge baths for a week or two, then try the bath again.
In addition to the supplies listed above, add,
    • an infant tub with 2 to 3 inches of warm — not hot! — water (to test the water temperature, feel the water with the inside of your elbow or wrist). An infant tub is a plastic tub that can fit in the bathtub; it's a better size for babies and makes bathing easier to manage.
Undress your baby and then place him or her in the water immediately, in a warm room, to prevent chills. Make sure the water in the tub is no more than 2 to 3 inches deep, and that the water is no longer running in the tub. Use one of your hands to support the head and the other hand to guide the baby in feet-first. Speaking gently, slowly lower your baby up to the chest into the tub.
Use a washcloth to wash his or her face and hair. Gently massage your baby's scalp with the pads of your fingers or a soft baby hairbrush, including the area over the fontanelles (soft spots) on the top of the head. When you rinse the soap or shampoo from your baby's head, cup your hand across the forehead so the suds run toward the sides and soap doesn't get into the eyes. Gently wash the rest of your baby's body with water and a small amount of soap.
Throughout the bath, regularly pour water gently over your baby's body so he or she doesn't get cold. After the bath, wrap your baby in a towel immediately, making sure to cover his or her head. Baby towels with hoods are great for keeping a freshly washed baby warm.
While bathing your infant, never leave the baby alone. If you need to leave the bathroom, wrap the baby in a towel and take him or her with you.</h6>
	<li>Circumcision and Umbilical Cord Care</li>
	<h6>Immediately after circumcision, the tip of the penis is usually covered with gauze coated with petroleum jelly to keep the wound from sticking to the diaper. Gently wipe the tip clean with warm water after a diaper change, then apply petroleum jelly to the tip so it doesn't stick to the diaper. Redness or irritation of the penis should heal within a few days, but if the redness or swelling increases or if pus-filled blisters form, infection may be present and you should call your baby's doctor immediately.
Umbilical cord care in newborns is also important. Some doctors suggest swabbing the area with rubbing alcohol until the cord stump dries up and falls off, usually in 10 days to 3 weeks, but others recommend leaving the area alone. Talk to your child's doctor to see what he or she prefers.
An infant's navel area shouldn't be submerged in water until the cord stump falls off and the area is healed. Until it falls off, the cord stump will change color from yellow to brown or black — this is normal. Call your doctor if the navel area looks red or if a foul odor or discharge develops.</h6>
	<li>Feeding and Burping Your Baby</li>
	<h6>Newborns eat often. Whether you're breastfeeding, expressing milk, or formula feeding, you'll likely be offering the breast or bottle 8 to 12 times per day or every 2 to 3 hours. 
A newborn will initially consume about an ounce per feeding, graduating to 2 to 3 ounces by 2 weeks of age and 4 to 6 ounces by 3 months. 
Babies go through sudden growth spurts, so you might find your little one sometimes requires more frequent feedings and/or additional ounces. Cluster feeds can have a breastfeeding mom nursing around the clock — so trust your instinct and watch for hunger cues. 
If your baby is steadily gaining weight and consistently wetting diapers, you can feel confident they're getting what they need.
Whether feeding your newborn by breast or a bottle, you may be stumped as to how often to do so. Generally, it's recommended that babies be fed on demand — whenever they seem hungry. Your baby may cue you by crying, putting fingers in his or her mouth, or making sucking noises.
If you're formula-feeding, you can easily monitor if your baby is getting enough to eat, but if you're breastfeeding, it can be a little trickier. If your baby seems satisfied, produces about six wet diapers and several stools a day, sleeps well, and is gaining weight regularly, then he or she is probably eating enough.
Another good way to tell if your baby is getting milk is to notice if your breasts feel full before feeding your baby and less full after feeding. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about your child's growth or feeding schedule.
Babies often swallow air during feedings, which can make them fussy. To help prevent this, burp your baby often. Try burping your baby every 2–3 ounces (60–90 milliliters) if you bottle-feed, and each time you switch breasts if you breastfeed.
If your baby tends to be gassy, has gastroesophageal reflux, or seems fussy during feeding, try burping your little one after every ounce during bottle-feeding or every 5 minutes during breastfeeding.</h6>
	<h5>Try these burping tips,</h5>
	<li>Hold your baby upright with his or her head on your shoulder. Support your baby's head and back while gently patting the back with your other hand.</li>
	<li>Sit your baby on your lap. Support your baby's chest and head with one hand by cradling your baby's chin in the palm of your hand and resting the heel of your hand on your baby's chest (be careful to grip your baby's chin — not throat). Use the other hand to gently pat your baby's back.</li>
	<li>Lay your baby face-down on your lap. Support your baby's head, making sure it's higher than his or her chest, and gently pat or rub his or her back.</li>
	<h5>If your baby doesn't burp after a few minutes, change the baby's position and try burping for another few minutes before feeding again. Always burp your baby when feeding time is over, then keep him or her in an upright position for at least 10–15 minutes to avoid spitting up.</h5>

        Baby soothing to sleep

    <div id="flush-collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingFour" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body"><strong>average a brand new baby will snooze for 14 to 17 hours in a 24-hour span. Unfortunately, this sleep schedule is quite erratic. New babies have shorter sleep cycles and more frequent wakings. Moreover, many babies start off with their days and nights confused, further fueling the exhaustive routine. 
Fortunately, around 6 to 8 weeks, babies begin to sleep less during the day and more in the evening hours. While most infants won't sleep through the night for another few months (many stop needing nighttime feedings around the 4- to 6-month mark), it's encouraging to know that longer stretches will come as you approach the end of the fourth trimester.


When can you expect your baby to sleep through the night? Many babies sleep through the night (between 6–8 hours) at 3 months of age, but if yours doesn't, it's not a cause for concern. Like adults, babies must develop their own sleep patterns and cycles, so if your newborn is gaining weight and appears healthy, don't despair if he or she hasn't slept through the night at 3 months.</strong>
	<h5>How to place baby on Bed</h5>
	<h6>It's important to always place babies on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). Other safe sleeping practices include, not using blankets, quilts, sheepskins, stuffed animals, and pillows in the crib or bassinet (these can suffocate a baby); and sharing a bedroom (but not a bed) with the parents for the first 6 months to 1 year. Also be sure to alternate the position of your baby's head from night to night (first right, then left, and so on) to prevent the development of a flat spot on one side of the head.
Baby Night Sleep 
Many newborns have their days and nights "mixed up." They tend to be more awake and alert at night, and more sleepy during the day. One way to help them is to keep stimulation at night to a minimum. Keep the lights low, such as by using a nightlight. Reserve talking and playing with your baby for the daytime. When your baby wakes up during the day, try to keep him or her awake a little longer by talking and playing.
Even though you may feel anxious about handling a newborn, in a few short weeks you'll develop a routine and be parenting like a pro! If you have questions or concerns, ask your doctor to recommend resources that can help you and your baby grow together.</h6>
	<h5>interpreting  baby crying</h5>
	<h6>A newborn cries as a means of communication. It's their way of letting you know they're wet, distressed, tired, uncomfortable, or hungry. 
It can be disheartening listening to a baby's incessant wails; but, rest assured, that periods of fussing are completely normal, and crying usually peaks around 6 weeks of age — so there is a light at the end of the fourth-trimester tunnel. 
If a healthy baby cries for 3 or more hours a day for 3 weeks, they may be suffering from colic. While many people believe colic may be connected to tummy troubles, the underlying causes are actually unknown. 
Holding and comforting your newborn is key during these ornery hours, but it might not completely quell the crying. It can be trying while it lasts, but colic is temporary and typically ends in tandem with the fourth trimester.</h6>
	<h7>What you can do</h7>
	<h6>Babies seem to have it made, but life on the outside is harder than it looks, and your wee one may need constant comforting and care during these first weeks. 
The good news, You can't spoil a newborn. Holding them for extended periods of time will not make them dependent, so feel free to snuggle to your heart's content and your baby's satisfaction. They'll thrive with your close attention and affection. 
There are some additional tactics you can try,</h6>
	<h5>The 5 S's</h5>
	<h6>The stark and bright disruptions of a baby's new normal can be intimidating at first. Part of Karp's theory of the fourth trimester involves helping your baby to slowly adjust to the change of leaving the womb for the world. Recreate a serene gestation-like scene, and help them feel like they're back in the womb — safe, secure, and snug. 
The 5 S's, as coined by Karp, will help you find what works best for your baby.</h6>
	<h5>Swaddle</h5>
	<h6>Bundling a baby and restricting the free movement of their arms and legs can have an instantly calming effect on a fussy newborn. It mimics the snugness they experienced in the womb and reduces the startle reflex. 
Swaddling may also work well to help your baby sleep. Keep in mind that — like the fourth trimester — swaddling is temporary and should be stopped once your baby starts trying to roll over</h6>
	<h5>Side or stomach</h5>
	<h6>While a baby should always be placed on their back for sleep, you can soothe a fussing newborn by holding them on their side or by placing them over your shoulder and gently putting pressure on their tummy.</h6>
	<h5>Shush</h5>
<h6>The perpetual sound of blood rushing around your body helped lull your baby into a state of relaxation while in utero. White noise machines can help create comforting acoustics during naps and bedtime</h6>
	<h5>Swing</h5>
	<h6>For 9 months, you were your baby's on-the-go swing. Your perpetual movements would rock your little one to sleep inside the womb. 
Whether you cradle your baby and gently sway, sit in a glider, or use a fancy swing, experiment with different motions and speed to find a rhythm that soothes your baby.</h6>
	<h5>Suck</h5>
	<h6>Sucking is a reflex and an innately reassuring action, and pacifiers can help a newborn self-soothe. Note that if you are breastfeeding, you might want to wait a few weeks before introducing the binky to avoid potential nipple confusion.</h6>
	<h5>Bonding and Soothing</h5>
	<h6>Bonding, probably one of the most pleasurable parts of infant care, happens during the sensitive time in the first hours and days after birth when parents make a deep connection with their infant. Physical closeness can promote an emotional connection.
For infants, the attachment contributes to their emotional growth, which also affects their development in other areas, such as physical growth. Another way to think of bonding is "falling in love" with your baby. Children thrive from having a parent or other adult in their life who loves them unconditionally.
Begin bonding by cradling your baby and gently stroking him or her in different patterns. Both you and your partner can also take the opportunity to be "skin-to-skin," holding your newborn against your own skin while feeding or cradling.</h6>
	<h5>All About Diapering</h5>
	<h6>You'll probably decide before you bring your baby home whether you'll use cloth or disposable diapers. Whichever you use, your little one will dirty diapers about 10 times a day, or about 70 times a week.
Before diapering your baby, make sure you have all supplies within reach so you won't have to leave your infant unattended on the changing table. You'll need,
    • a clean diaper
    • fasteners (if cloth prefold diapers are used)
    • diaper ointment
    • diaper wipes (or a container of warm water and a clean washcloth or cotton balls)
After each bowel movement or if the diaper is wet, lay your baby on his or her back and remove the dirty diaper. Use the water, cotton balls, and washcloth or the wipes to gently wipe your baby's genital area clean. When removing a boy's diaper, do so carefully because exposure to the air may make him urinate. When wiping a girl, wipe her bottom from front to back to avoid a urinary tract infection (UTI). To prevent or heal a rash, apply ointment. Always remember to wash your hands thoroughly after changing a diaper.
Diaper rash is a common concern. Typically the rash is red and bumpy and will go away in a few days with warm baths, some diaper cream, and a little time out of the diaper. Most rashes happen because the baby's skin is sensitive and becomes irritated by the wet or poopy diaper.
To prevent or heal diaper rash, try these tips,
    • Change your baby's diaper often, and as soon as possible after bowel movements.
    • Gently clean the area with mild soap and water (wipes sometimes can be irritating), then apply a very thick layer of diaper rash or "barrier" cream. Creams with zinc oxide are preferred because they form a barrier against moisture.
    • If you use cloth diapers, wash them in dye- and fragrance-free detergents.
    • Let the baby go undiapered for part of the day. This gives the skin a chance to air out.
If the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be getting worse, call your doctor — it may be caused by a fungal infection that requires a prescription.
</h6>
	<h5>Other tactics</h5>
	<h6>Some newborns respond well to water and are soothed by a warm bath. Others enjoy a gentle massage. Wearing a baby in a sling or carrier can also be very effective; they free your arms but give your sweetie the physical closeness they crave. 
Remember that a newborn can easily become overstimulated, so keep things dim and quiet whenever possible. </h6></div>

      <div class="accordion-body"><strong>Becoming a parent is transformative. In a split second, you become responsible for a tiny and helpless human being (no pressure). 
The early days of parenthood will be rewarding and stressful — full of exciting firsts and tremendous trials. These challenging 12 weeks will test your patience and exhaust you beyond measure. 
It's a push and pull; you'll want to relish every moment while eagerly awaiting a more predictable phase. 
The emotional and physical toll
It's normal to feel a range of emotions as a new parent. One moment you'll be elated, the next you'll question your ability to raise a child. The fourth trimester is a bumpy ride full of highs and lows.
One of the challenges is feeling on your own. In contrast to the regular doctor visits and checkups you experienced at the end of your pregnancy, after delivery you may not see your own caregiver again for 4 to 6 weeks. 
During those first few weeks, many birth parents will experience a fleeting case of the “baby blues.” Postpartum depression, on the other hand, sticks around and can have a completely oppressive presence in a new parent's life. 
If you are feeling helpless, hopeless, or unable to take care of yourself and your baby, seek professional help.
Postpartum Support International (PSI) offers a phone crisis line (800-944-4773) and text support (503-894-9453), as well as referrals to local providers. 
In the first 6 to 8 weeks, a birth parent is also recovering from the very real trauma of childbirth, be it a vaginal delivery or C-section. 
Vaginal soreness from delivery can make just about any level of activity uncomfortable, and bleeding and cramping may continue for weeks. And if you had a C-section, you will need even more downtime as your body recovers from major surgery. 
Most birth parents will have their first postpartum checkup 6 weeks after giving birth, but that wait can feel interminable when you are hurting physically or suffering emotionally — so never hesitate to reach out to your doctor. 
No two recoveries are completely alike, and you need to listen to your body. It can be hard to strike balance between taking care of yourself and tending to your baby, but a healthy, happy parent is more equipped for the journey of parenthood, so be sure to prioritize your own needs too.
Takeaway
The fourth trimester is what you've been waiting for — your baby has arrived and you are officially a parent! Enjoy this fleeting time. It will be frustrating, draining, and so incredibly rewarding. 
Your baby might struggle to adjust to life outside the womb in those first 12 weeks, too, but they will find comfort and contentment in your loving arms. You've got this. 


Your Child's First Year of Development

Great Expectations, Baby's First Year
Caring for an infant can be exhausting, but there's so much to look forward to. Take a tour of first-year "firsts" with WebMD's guide to the most anticipated baby milestones.


Smiles
After two months of sleepless nights and round-the-clock soothing, you've seen plenty of your baby's tears. Maybe you've spotted a fleeting smile, but then again, it could have been gas. Now it's time for the real reward. By around 2 months of age, your baby will smile in response to you!  The sound of your voice or the sight of your face is often all it takes to trigger your baby's irresistible grin
Laughs
If the frequent sound of your baby's crying has you on edge, take heart. By 4 months, you can look forward to another sound, possibly the sweetest you'll ever hear -- your baby's laughter. The best part is how easily a baby laughs. Silly faces, tickling, and peek-a-boo are usually more than enough to set off lots of squeals and giggles.

Sleeps All Night
Like no other baby milestone, a full night of sleep becomes the Holy Grail for new parents. While it is unrealistic and unhealthy to expect a newborn to sleep all night, parents can rest assured that relief will come soon. By 4-6 months, most babies are capable of sleeping through the night.
Sits Up
How different the world looks when you're not stuck on your belly! Around 5 or 6 months, most babies can sit up with support -- either by resting on their hands in front of them or by leaning on pillows or furniture. Babies can usually sit alone steadily by 7-9 months.
Crawls
If you have an 8-month-old, you may want to put your gym membership on hold. You're about to get plenty of exercise chasing your suddenly mobile baby around the house. By 9 months, most babies crawl using both hands and feet, though some babies never crawl, preferring to creep or wriggle instead. Crawling is not an essential baby milestone, and infants who choose to scoot or creep still tend to reach other milestones on schedule.
Waves 'Bye-Bye'
Waving "bye-bye" is not just a cute trick -- it is an actual expression of language. By 9 months most babies begin to make the link between sounds, gestures, and meaning. They understand that waving is connected to the phrase "bye-bye."
Eats Finger Food
Just when spoon-feeding begins to lose its luster, babies are ready to feed themselves. Between 9-12 months, babies develop better control over their hands and fingers, making it easier to grab small objects -- like finger foods! Unfortunately, babies this age love to explore taste and texture, so food is not the only thing they'll try to pop into their mouths. Environmental safety should, therefore, become a big parental concern at this age.
Stands
By 12 months, most babies begin to stand briefly without support. They also take small steps while holding onto furniture or other objects, an activity called "cruising." In the weeks or months before they walk independently, babies may spend hours cruising to practice for the real thing.
Takes a Step
You might call it the crown jewel of baby milestones. Perhaps no other moment is met with more anticipation (or camera clicks) than a baby's first step on their own. But not all babies walk by their first birthday. The normal range is anywhere from 9 to 17 months, with most babies taking at least a few steps by about 13 months.

Says a Word
"Mama! Dada!" There's nothing like hearing your baby call your name, and it usually happens right around the one-year mark. By this time, most babies can say at least one real word and actively try to imitate others. It won't be long before you finally get to hear what's on your little one's mind.</strong></div>
